# Virus Spread Simulation — Agent-Based Modeling with NetLogo

## Project Overview

This project presents an **Agent-Based Model (ABM)** developed in **NetLogo** to simulate the spread of a virus within a population. Each individual is modeled as an autonomous agent following realistic daily routines such as working, shopping, and staying at home. Through local interactions, the model demonstrates how epidemic patterns emerge at the population level.

The simulation also integrates **government policy interventions** and **economic activity modeling**, enabling analysis of the trade-off between public health protection and economic productivity.

This repository contains the **complete project package**, including the simulation model, project report, and video walkthrough.

## What This Project Demonstrates

* Agent-Based Modeling of epidemic spread
* Local interaction–driven infection dynamics
* Disease stage progression (Incubation → Contagious → Symptomatic)
* Policy interventions such as curfews and interval work
* Economic impact analysis (Gross economy & Shops economy)
* Emergent behavior in complex systems

## Repository Contents

You can explore the project through the following materials:

* **NetLogo Model File** – The complete simulation model
* **Project Report (PDF)** – Detailed documentation of methodology, design, and results
* **Project Video** – Visual walkthrough of the simulation working

## How to Explore the Project

### Option 1 — Download Full Project Package

Click the **Code** button → **Download ZIP** to get the complete project including model, documentation, and video.

### Option 2 — Explore Files Individually

You may directly open or download:

* NetLogo model to run the simulation
* PDF report for theoretical and technical understanding
* Video for visual demonstration of working

## How to Run the Simulation

1. Install **NetLogo (version 6.1.1 or compatible)**
2. Open the `.nlogo` file from the Model folder
3. Click **SETUP** to initialize the environment
4. Click **GO** to start the simulation

## Learning Purpose

This project is designed as an **educational and experimental platform**, not a predictive medical model. It helps understand:

* Epidemic dynamics
* Human behavior influence
* Policy impact
* Emergence in complex systems
